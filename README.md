# awesome-polkadot

An opinionated list of awesome resources in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Goal

The problem I found with other awesome lists is that there are so many links and resources, that quality is lost to the noise, and approachability becomes overwhelming.

Unlike other awesome lists, this is NOT meant to be a comprehensive list for all options available in the Polkadot ecosystem. Instead, this is a very opinionated and unapologetic list of resources which I find useful and that I use myself.

You can feel confident that if you use these same resources, they will work and provide a great experience.

If you find any problems with any of the resources in this list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/awesome-polkadot/issues).

## Education

Here are my favorite resources to get you caught up with all things Polkadot.

Developer educational resources can be found in the [Developer](#developer) section below.

### The Basics

If you are just getting started in the Polkadot ecosystem, the following resources will be super useful to begin your journey to learn about and understand Polkadot.

- [The Polkadot Cloud](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-polkadot-cloud/10670)

	This is a forum post which describes Polkadot not only as a world-scale supercomputer, but also a Web3 cloud for a more resilient and decentralized internet.

- [The Polkadot Homepage](https://polkadot.com/)

	This is the official homepage for the Polkadot Network. Follow the story of Polkadot told by this site and learn the basics.

- [The Decisions of Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQckxpMUBo8)

	This is a presentation that I gave describing the philosophies, goals, and decisions of developing the Polkadot Network. Obviously there is a bit of bias here, but I think this is a great resource, not just to understand what Polkadot is today, but its overall vision and principles.

- [The Polkadot Playbook](playbook.md)

	Simple, accurate answers to common questions about Polkadot, backed by extensive references and source material, empowering anyone to become a Polkadot ambassador.

- [The Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy)

	The PBA is an 5-week in person course designed to onboard existing software developers into the Polkadot and broader blockchain ecosystem. All resources for the academy are available online for free.

	- Course Content: https://polkadot-blockchain-academy.github.io/pba-book/
	- Video Recordings: https://www.youtube.com/@polkadotblockchainacademy/

- [Substrate Kitties](https://dotcodeschool.com/courses/substrate-kitties)

	Build your first Polkadot SDK Pallet which functions as a simple NFT Marketplace where you can create, transfer, buy, and sell NFT Kitties.

### Templates

You can find known working and up to date templates for developing in Polkadot here:

- [Polkadot SDK Templates](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/templates/index.html)
- Polkadot API (Frontend/TypeScript): Find working examples on their [GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-api)

### Tooling

- [Getting Started Script](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/scripts/getting-started.sh)

	This script installs all the prerequisites required to start development with the Polkadot SDK.

	You can execute the script in one line like so:

	```sh
	curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/master/scripts/getting-started.sh -sSf | sh
	```

- [The Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)

	All development in Polkadot basically revolves around the Polkadot SDK. This project is composed of sub-projects: Substrate, Polkadot, Cumulus. The Polkadot SDK includes useful binaries for doing development.

	Install those binaries locally by running:

	```sh
	cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/ polkadot polkadot-parachain-bin staging-chain-spec-builder polkadot-execute-worker polkadot-prepare-worker
	```

- [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet)

	In order to run a parachain, you must simulate a Polkadot network with a relay chain and multiple validators. Zombienet can do this for you with a simple CLI and config. Very useful for doing local testing on a "live network" starting from genesis.

<details>
	<summary>Additional Tools</summary>

These additional tools are more relevant for maintaining a Polkadot SDK project, rather than starting one.

- [Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks)

	Chopsticks is a tool that allows developers to simulate and test complex blockchain scenarios without deploying to a "live network" (i.e. no need for a relay chain). It is particularly useful at forking any already-live chain, modifying it, and then testing the effects of your modifications.

- [Polkadot SDK Version Manager](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm)

	The Polkadot SDK exports hundreds of different crates which all maintain their own semantic versioning. To keep your project compatible with Polkadot, you need to make sure all of these crates are using the same versions as the Polkadot network itself. PSVM is a tool which will go through your rust project, and make sure that all versions of all crates are correct for your targeted Polkadot SDK version.

- [Zepter](https://github.com/ggwpez/zepter)

	A common problem for new developers building a Polkadot SDK project is correctly importing new crates and handling all the feature flags for their newly imported crates. Zepter is a tool which can automatically detect and fix and format feature flags across your Polkadot SDK project.

- [Substrate JS Utilities](https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-js-utilities/)

	A simple webpage allowing you perform many basic conversions and operations, for example hash a string or change the prefix of an address. Useful when working with the Polkadot SDK in general.
